        <h3 class="foglalkozas">biophysicist</h3>
        <p class="szemelyes"> I am a really nerd person, who likes interesting things, and to always learn
            something new. I love to try out new things. I like the play basketball,
            table-tennis, volley-ball, but I love to sit in front of my play station
            and play games for ours. I love to read, and I love to go for hikes. But I also
            love to stay in bed, watch a movie meanwhile I am making embrodiery.
        </p>
        <p class="szemelyes"> I've studied biophysics in University and I loved it, but life had another
             plan for me. In Uni I had the chance to get to know programming, 
             and I always found it fascinating. So now I am here, to learn as much as I can.

        <p>Technology is the result of accumulated knowledge and application 
            of skills, methods, and processes used in industrial production and 
            scientific research. Technology is embedded in the operation of all 
            machines and electronic devices, with or without detailed knowledge of 
            their function, for the intended purpose of an organization. 
            The technologies of society consist of what is known as systems. 
            Systems operate by obtaining an input, altering this input through 
            what is known as a process, and then producing an outcome that 
            achieves the intended purpose of the system.
